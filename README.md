This is an unofficial SDK written by community members for the Printful API as described at the following [link](https://developers.printful.com/docs/).

The package and repository are not developed, maintained, nor supported by  PrintfulÂ® Inc or its associates.

The original author of the package developed the SDK to use it in his projects that require Print-On-Demand services. He is merely sharing it with fellow developers who are looking for such a solution.
